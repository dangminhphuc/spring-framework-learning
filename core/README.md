# Core Technologies of the Spring Framework

> Core technologies of the Spring Framework â€” the foundation for all other modules.

---

## Overview

This module contains essential infrastructure features of the Spring Framework. These features provide the foundation
for dependency injection, resource loading, type conversion, expression parsing, AOP, and more.

Spring Core is the heart of the framework, and learning it deeply helps you understand how higher-level modules like
Spring Boot and Spring Data work under the hood.
