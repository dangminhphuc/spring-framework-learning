# Gemini Project Brief: Spring Framework Learning

## Context

- **Project Purpose:** A multi-module Maven project designed for learning the Spring Framework from foundational concepts to advanced topics ("zero to hero").
- **Technology Stack:** Java, Spring Framework, Maven for dependency management, and JUnit for testing.
- **Project Structure:** The project is organized into modules. The root `pom.xml` manages shared dependencies. Core Spring concepts are demonstrated in individual sub-modules located under the `spring-core/` directory. Each module is self-contained to clearly illustrate a specific feature.

## Instructions

- **Documentation:** For each new module or major feature, create or update a `README.md` file. This file should explain the concept being demonstrated, the key classes involved, and how to run the example.

## Input

- When requesting a new learning module, please specify the Spring concept to be Â¬demonstrated (e.g., "Bean Scopes", "Aspect-Oriented Programming").

## Output

- Always explain the purpose of a shell command before executing it.
- After implementing a concept, create or update the relevant `README.md` to explain it.
- Verify changes by running the appropriate tests.
- Propose a clear and conventional commit message after verification.
