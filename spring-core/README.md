# Core Technologies of the Spring Framework

> Core technologies — the essential foundation for all other modules in the Spring ecosystem.

## Overview

This module covers Spring’s essential building blocks — core features like dependency injection, AOP, resource handling,
expression evaluation, and more — that power all Spring applications, from classic monoliths to modern reactive
microservices.

## Key Features

| Feature                               | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **IoC Container**                     | Manages object lifecycle, configuration, and dependency injection.          |
| **Resources**                         | Uniform access to files and resources (classpath, filesystem, URLs).        |
| **Validation & Conversion**           | APIs for type conversion and validation in data binding and forms.          |
| **Spring Expression Language (SpEL)** | Expression language for dynamic querying and manipulation of object graphs. |
| **AOP Basics**                        | Aspect-oriented programming support for cross-cutting concerns.             |
| **Spring AOP API**                    | APIs for defining aspects, with AspectJ integration.                        |
| **Null-Safety**                       | Support for `@Nullable` and `@NonNull` annotations to improve code safety.  |
| **Data Buffers & Codecs**             | Efficient I/O for reactive and non-blocking contexts.                       |
| **Logging**                           | Unified logging abstraction via SLF4J with pluggable backends.              |
| **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Processing**    | Build-time optimization for GraalVM native images and faster startup.       |
